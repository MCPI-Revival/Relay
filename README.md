Instead of relying on this, ask @NikZapp directly.
## Server config
The configuration file `servers.json` contains the names of the servers, as well as their host, port, authentication requirements and the protected areas. 
The name "main" should always be present, as it will be the default server to which the clients are connected.
## Chat
To send something to all connected clients, edit the `chat.txt` file. Anything written inside will be sent. Use this instead of the normal MCPI API.
